# PUSHSWAP

Creating a sorting algorithm in PHP


## Description of the subject

- The objective of the program is to sort **la** in ascending order (from smallest to largest):
    - **sa**: exchanges the positions of the first two elements of **la** (nothing happens if there are not enough elements).
    - **sb**: swaps the positions of the first two elements of **lb** (nothing happens if there are not enough elements).
    - **sc** : **sa** and **sb** at the same time.
    - **pa**: takes the first element of **lb** and places it in the first position of **la** (nothing happens if **lb** is empty).
    - **pb**: takes the first element of the and places it at the first position of **lb** (nothing happens if **la** is empty).
    - **ra**: rotates **la** to the beginning. (the first element becomes the last).
    - **rb**: rotates **lb** to the beginning (the first element becomes the last).
    - **rr** : **ra** and **rb** at the same time.
    - **rra**: rotates **la** to the end. (the last element becomes the first).
    - **rrb**: rotates **lb** to the end. (the last element becomes the first).
    - **rrr** : **rra** and **rrb** at the same time.
